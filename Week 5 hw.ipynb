    "For example, I want to find the average height of all the students in UofT. I start by measuring the height of my classmates. The heights that I record from this sample are represented by the symbol x with a small i. The average height of this sample group is the sample mean, which is the symbol of x with a line on top. My goal is to make a conclusion on the average height of all the students in UofT (the population mean), even though I do not have all the data of everyone. My assumption of this average is a specific number, this is called null hypothesis. The main point of this test is that I am making a conclusion for the average of all students in UofT, not just the students in my classroom. "

    "P-value is used to determine how likely the data is, with the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct. When the p-value is very small, it means that the chance of seeing such extreme results is very low. This makes the null hypothesis very unbelievable, ridiculous. The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to a conclusion where the alternative hypothesis might be better. "

    "In the original experiment, Dr. Muriel Bristol claimed that she could tell the difference between whether milk or tea was poured first. She proved herself by identifying 8 cups (4 with milk and 4 with tea) all correctly. In the STA130 experiment, a group of 80 students tested, 49 students correctly identified the pouring order. The difference between the two experiments are that the second one has a larger scale of sample size. \n",

    "Since the p-value of 0.0221 is less than 0.05, I have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that the proportion of students who correctly identified whether tea or milk was poured first is greater than 50%. The 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of students who can correctly identify the order of pouring is (0.5057, 0.7193). Since 50% (0.5) is outside of this interval, this also supports the conclusion that more than half of the students in the sample were able to correctly identify the pouring order. "
